Ruby Excercise
==============

In the locker room, there is one wall on which can be installed lockers.

There are two types of lockers, long term rental and daily rental. A locker can be assigned to one owner.  Each owner has one name and address.

Code in ruby to represent the above scenerio.  Implement the following methods:

	- assign a new owner to a locker that is currently vacant.
	- assign a new owner to a locker at given coordinates, if it is currently vacant.
	- get the owner's name by the coordinates of the locker on one wall.
	- find the locker by a owner's name and return the coordinates of the locker.
	- count the number of long term rental lockers.
	- count the number of daily rental lockers.
	- count the number of vacant lockers.

Unit test the code.
